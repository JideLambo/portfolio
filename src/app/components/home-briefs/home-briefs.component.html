    <h2>I'm Jide (pronounced: Ji-Day), and I am a passionate user experience and product designer.</h2>
    <article class="brief-desc">

      <p>I have an extensive on-the-job training in user experience design and over 5 years of product design experience with consumer-facing products. But most of all, I'm a typical learner.</p>
      <p>With a deep understanding of user-centered design, I have experience with entire product design cycle, from research, to wireframes, to mockups,
        to prototypes, through to the final design and implementation. I also understand and use web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with angular framework).
      </p>

      <p>I currently work with the mobile development team at GTBank where we collaborate closely to design easy-to-use product experience for our customers.</p>

      <p class="no-margin">You can read about my design process detailing how I research my users, generate interview questions, design prototypes, test prototypes, and iterate design from feedback.</p>

      <p>I'm a dad to a sweet little girl and husband to Maryann. My wife and I are both digital nomads digital. We both help out in our community by teaching design,
        web development and digital marketing. </p>

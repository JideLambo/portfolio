      <p>As a designer, I have the responsibility to design software
        products that are focused on the human experience; products that are usable.</p>

      </p>
      <p>With a deep understanding of user-centered design, I work with the entire product design cycle,
        from research to prototype designs, testing prototypes against context of use and responsive UI code
        implementation. I also understand and build web/mobile applications with Front-end web technologies
        such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</p>

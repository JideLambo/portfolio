    <h2>Hi, I'm Jide, and I design products for web and mobile platforms.</h2>

    <article class="brief-desc">
      <p>I currently design experiences on both web and mobile platforms with 
        the mobile development team at GTBank.com. I absolutely love learning 
        about new web technologies. I read alot of action-packed books and fantasize 
        about travelling the world.</p>
      <p class="no-margin">I make constant effort to learn more about how to use design thinking to solve everyday problem. You can read 
          about my design process detailing how I research my user stakeholders, 
          generate interview questions, design prototypes, test prototypes, and iterate design from 
          feedback.</p>

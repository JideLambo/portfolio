    <h2>Hi again, ðŸ™‚</h2>

    <article class="about-desc">
      <p>Iâ€™m a Helsinki-based user experience &amp; user-interface designer. My professional journey started as I nurtured my creative side through graphic design, and later on became proficient in prototype design, user interface development, and recently service design.</p>
      <p>My passion as a user experience (UX) designer is derived from the deep interest in how people connect with services, and products - and a passion for cultures, fuelled by years of reading books by foreign authors.</p>
      <p>Iâ€™ve collaborated with awesome people to design products for the road travel industry in Africa, SaaS products, fintech applications, user-generated content business, and most recently products around cloud services.
        I focus on solving problems and creating coherent, clean and simple experiences across the devices I design for. The user is always at the center of my process. </p>
      <p>In addition to my day job, I spend time teaching how to code with HTML and CSS. When I'm not working, I enjoy taking city photographs, and horse back riding.</p>
      <p>I extend my ability to develop more effective web and mobile apps with HTML5, SCSS, Javascript.</p>

    <h2>Hi, I'm Jide.</h2>

    <article class="about-desc">
      <p>I’m a Lagos-based user experience &amp; user-interface designer working on productivity applications at GTBank. My professional journey started as I nurtured my creative side through graphic and user experience design, and later on became proficient in user interface development.</p>
      <p>My passion as a user experience (UX) designer is derived from the deep interest in how people connect with services, and products - and a passion for cultures, fuelled by years of reading books by foreign authors.</p>
      <p>I’ve collaborated with awesome friends to design products for the road travel industry in Africa, SaaS products and fintech applications. I focus on solving problems and creating coherent, clean and simple experiences across the devices I design for. The user is always at the center of my process. </p>
      <p>In addition to my day job, I spend time teaching how to code with HTML and CSS. When not working, I enjoy spending time with my family, my wife Maryann, a digital marketer, and my daughter.</p>
      <p>I also enjoy extending my ability to develop more effective web solutions and mobile apps with HTML5, SCSS, Javascript. With an interest in building, I can code with Angular and Typescript. I also build hybrid mobile apps with Ionic frameworks.

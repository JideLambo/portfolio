      <p>
        Iâ€™m a Helsinki-based user experience &amp; user-interface designer. My
        professional journey started as I nurtured my creative side through
        graphic design, and later on became proficient in prototype design, user
        interface development, and recently service design.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion as a user driven designer is derived from the deep interest
        in how people connect with services, and products - and a passion for
        cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™ve collaborated with awesome people to design products for the road
        travel industry, SaaS products, fintech applications, user-generated
        content business, and most recently products around cloud services. I
        focus on solving problems and creating coherent, clean and simple
        experiences across the devices I design for. The user is always at the
        center of my process.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my day job, I spend time teaching how to design
        interfaces and code with HTML, CSS, JS, React and Vue. When I'm not
        working, I enjoy taking city photographs, bike riding for long miles and
        horse back riding.

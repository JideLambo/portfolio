    <article class="text-lg leading-10">
      <p class="mb-6">
        Iâ€™m a Helsinki-based product designer with Front-end development skills.
        I've had the opportunity to design products in the space of digital
        media agency, Saas tech, fintech (banking), road transportation,
        AI-driven platform, and cloud-based tech products.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        My journey started as a self-taught designer while working at Crawford
        University, Nigeria in 2012, then I joined Deefrent - A digital agency
        in 2015 where I worked on clients projects ranging from e-commerce
        websites to portfolio websites, to Government web portals. Later in
        2016, I joined GIGM.com - the biggest road transportation company in
        Nigeria, and led the design team in designing and developing the
        customer's booking platform both on mobile and web. I also focused on
        designing usable web experience for in-house tools.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        After my time at GIGM.com, I joined Guaranty Trust Bank, where my main
        focus was building the customer's mobile banking app called GTWorld.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        In late 2018, I joined BCaster.com - a Finland startup that automates
        user generating contents for businesses. I led the design team where I
        helped guide the user experience for both the customers and in-house
        products. As a startup team, I took up designing and developing user
        interfaces and experiences for the customer's dashboard, and Web-apps.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        In 2020, I joined the Intergalactico design team with Nordcloud. As a
        cloud-first company, my role has been focused on designing user
        experiences for cloud-based applications.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        My work gives me vast experience in design reviews, product design, web
        accessibility, front-end web development, user research, and usability
        testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside work, I enjoy taking city photographs, bike riding for long
        miles, and horseback riding.
